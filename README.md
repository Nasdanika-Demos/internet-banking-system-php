The the above diagram is a [System Context diagram](https://c4model.com/#SystemContextDiagram), which is

> a good starting point for diagramming and 
> documenting a software system, allowing you to step back 
> and see the big picture. Draw a diagram showing your system as a box
>  in the centre, surrounded by its users and the other systems that it
> interacts with.

## How To

This site was generated from a [Drawio](https://www.drawio.com/) diagram of an Internet Banking System, which was created based on images and descriptions from [The C4 model for visualising software architecture](https://c4model.com/).
Descriptions of elements and diagrams were copied verbatim under the terms of [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
The diagram uses free icons from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) to provide visual distinction between architecture elements. 

The diagram and the site are hosted in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Nasdanika-Demos/internet-banking-system) which was created from [Drawio Site](https://github.com/Nasdanika-Templates/drawio-site) template repository.

Documentation site is generated by [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) using 
[Nasdanika CLI Drawio Command](https://docs.nasdanika.org/nsd-cli/nsd/drawio/index.html) 
[drawio](https://docs.nasdanika.org/nsd-cli/nsd/drawio/index.html) > [html-app](https://docs.nasdanika.org/nsd-cli/nsd/drawio/html-app/index.html) > [site](https://docs.nasdanika.org/nsd-cli/nsd/drawio/html-app/site/index.html) command pipeline.
The generated site is deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

See the template repository for more details including a quick start video.

## Diagram library

There is a demo diagram library ``https://nasdanika-demos.github.io/internet-banking-system/ibs-library.xml`` which can be added to Draw.io library.
